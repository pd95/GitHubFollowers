# GitHubFollowers

An iPhone App to checkout a GitHub users follower list and checking them out. It has the most important features like 
accessing an API, multiple screens implemented using MVC, autolayout based UI (implemented programmatically), use of 
`UICollectionView`, `UITableView` and various custom subviews.

Based on the "Take Home Project" course taught by [@SAllen0400](https://github.com/SAllen0400) at [teachable.com](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/take-home).

Everything up to the [Final tag](https://github.com/pd95/GitHubFollowers/releases/tag/Final) was based on Sean Allens course. 
The [branch course-branch](https://github.com/pd95/GitHubFollowers/tree/course-branch) will be used to follow further enhancements/corrections based on Seans course. Other adaptions on master and branches are based on my other iOS findings and learnings. 

The [refactor-use-storyboard branch](https://github.com/pd95/GitHubFollowers/tree/refactor-use-storyboard) illustrates how I adapted the course code back to a storyboard based solution. All the lessons related to autolayout constraints can also be used in the WYSIWYG storyboard world.
