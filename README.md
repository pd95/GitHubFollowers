# GitHubFollowers

An iPhone App to checkout a GitHub users follower list and checking them out. It has the most important features like 
accessing an API, multiple screens implemented using MVC, autolayout based UI (implemented programmatically), use of 
`UICollectionView`, `UITableView` and various custom subviews.

Based on the "Take Home Project" course taught by [@SAllen0400](https://github.com/SAllen0400) at [teachable.com](https://seanallen.teachable.com/p/take-home).

Everything up to the [Final tag](https://github.com/pd95/GitHubFollowers/releases/tag/Final) was based on Sean Allens course. 
Further upcoming adaptions/branches are based on my other iOS learnings.
